# Food-Beverages-Sale-Data-Analysis
Created Interactive Dashboard of Food & Beverages Services (Opportunity Analysis of a Major Food and Beverage Manufacturer)

Project Objective

Our client, the sales director of the Major Food and Beverage Manufacturer wants us to report hindsight and insight into his business based on provided datasets. Also, he wants us to create an interactive dashboard to analyze the sales opportunities available in non-commercial sections and adjacent to retail stores to grow his F&B services.

Case Statement

Get a quick view of the share of F&B spending from existing customers (restaurants) that F&B Company is getting, and if there are any opportunities in specific segments.
What are the adjacent opportunities from the non-commercial establishments to additionally sell into (note that there are no customers currently in the non-commercial segment)? Their finance data are not available, so will be interested in knowing relevant proxies that could indicate opportunities for us.
Retailers are a different business division and out of scope for me (Shaun), but some of my customers/prospects could be buying from these retailers – so getting a view of retailer presence adjacent to his customers & prospects will help understand how much of these opportunities are being met / unmet.
